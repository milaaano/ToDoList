# ToDoList
A to-do list web application built with Django. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Completed tasks are stored separately and displayed on a dedicated page, grouped by the date of completion. The project is designed to run locally and serves as a learning exercise in Django fundamentals.
